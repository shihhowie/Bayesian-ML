# Bayesian-ML

This repository consists of all the assignment and projects I did during my graduate course on Bayesian Machine Learning with Andrew Wilson. The code includes implementation and applications of Bayesian Marginal likelihood optimization using Laplace approximation and conjugate gradient descent, Bayesian graphical models and belief propagation, and finally project on applying multi-task Gaussian process to model spatio-temporal crime activity in Chicago.
